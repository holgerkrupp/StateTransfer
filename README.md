StateTransfer is a small tool to perform REST (Representational State Transfer) requests. The purpose is to test API calls prior to implementing them in your software. It also helps debugging when creating new APIs.

The tool was created after "[RESTed](https://github.com/helloresolven/rested)" has been removed from the App Store. The current Version of StateTransfer is not feature complete. StateTransfer can read part of RESTed files (\*.request).
